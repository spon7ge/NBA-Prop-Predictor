next steps:
- create model for blks, stls, and fg3m
- any single category that prizePicks offers before moving on to jointed categories
features id like to implement:
- position vs defense
- injury status prior to the game
- star player out or in (maybe: using play by play to get the starting lineup and see if the star player is in the lineup? )
- lineup changes
- team style of play
- coaching 
- play by play data to get tendencies
- player vs player espically if the player is a good defender
- altitude(utah and denver) works in favor of the home team

Backtest:
For each strategy track, per bet and cumulatively:
ROI (%) = (Total profit ÷ Total amount staked) × 100
Hit rate = (Number of winning bets) ÷ (Total bets)
Volatility = Standard deviation of daily P&L
Max drawdown = Largest peak-to-trough loss
Sharpe ratio = (Average daily return ÷ Std. dev. of daily returns) × √252

TEAM FEATURES:
Regularly update usual starters e.g., monthly to adapt to trades/injuries.
Log unusual values e.g., 0-2 usual starters → opportunity for big deviations.
Combine with opponent features: both teams lineup health can affect game pace and scoring.
