    "### Kelly Criterion\n",
    "The Kelly Criterion is a formula used to determine the optimal size of a series of bets. It aims to maximize the logarithm of wealth, balancing the trade-off between risk and reward. The formula considers both the probability of winning and the odds offered, guiding you on how much of your bankroll to wager on each bet.\n",

    "⚙️ Hybrid Approach Recommended\n",
    "For NBA prop betting, a hybrid workflow often works best:\n",
    "- Train an ML model to predict the expected prop value using features like usage rate, matchup context, rest, etc.\n",
    "- Simulate multiple game scenarios via Monte Carlo, using your ML model’s predictive distribution (e.g., add residual noise or use a Bayesian framework).\n",
    "- Bootstrap on your historical residuals to calibrate confidence intervals around those predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combines:\n",
    "ML’s ability to capture complex relationships,\n",
    "Monte Carlo’s capacity for modeling variability and outputting a full prob. distribution,\n",
    "Bootstrap’s non-parametric estimate of uncertainty—all necessary to assess value and risk correctly \n",

    "🗓️ Practical Takeaway\n",
    "Need a full probability distribution for value + risk? MC sim driven by your ML model is essential.\n",

    "\n",
    "📌 Final Recommendation\n",
    "Use Machine Learning to predict the mean prop, then Monte Carlo to simulate possible outcomes (using those ML predictions with added variance), and Bootstrap to quantify your confidence in those outcomes. This hybrid setup offers the most accurate, actionable probabilities for NBA prop betting.\n"
